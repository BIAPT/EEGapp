<h1>What is EEGapp?</h1>
<p>EEGapp is a pipeline with a Graphical User Interface that automatizes the analysis of EEG data using new techniques that are not yet offered in other processing pipelines. Analysis techniques like <b>Phase Lag Index</b>, <b>directed Phase Lag Index</b>, <b>Phase Amplitude Coupling</b> or <b>Symbolic Transfer Entropy</b> are all bundled into MATLAB functions along with all the necessary surrogate data analysis already implemented.</p>
