function  [lambda,efficiency,ecc,radius,diameter] = charpath(D)
%CHARPATH       Characteristic path length, global efficiency and related statistics
%
%   lambda = charpath(D);
%   [lambda,efficiency] = charpath(D);
%   [lambda,efficiency,ecc,radius,diameter] = charpath(D);
%
%   The characteristic path length is the average shortest path length in 
%   the network. The global efficiency is the average inverse shortest path
%   length in the network.
%
%   Input:      D,              distance matrix
%
%   Outputs:    lambda,         characteristic path length
%               efficiency,     global efficiency
%               ecc,            eccentricity (for each vertex)
%               radius,         radius of graph
%               diameter,       diameter of graph
%
%   Notes:
%       The input distance matrix may be obtained with any of the distance
%   functions, e.g. distance_bin, distance_wei.
%       Characteristic path length is calculated as the global mean of 
%   the distance matrix D, excludings any 'Infs' but including distances on
%   the main diagonal.

% Modification, 2010 (Mika Rubinov): incorporation of global efficiency

% Mean of finite entries of D(G)
lambda = sum(sum(D(D~=Inf)))/length(nonzeros(D~=Inf));

% Eccentricity for each vertex (note: ignore 'Inf') 
ecc = max(D.*(D~=Inf),[],2);

% Radius of graph
radius = min(ecc);  % but what about zeros?

% Diameter of graph
diameter = max(ecc);

% Efficiency: mean of inverse entries of D(G)
n = size(D,1);
D = 1./D;                           %invert distance
D(1:n+1:end) = 0;                   %set diagonal to 0
efficiency = sum(D(:))/(n*(n-1));   %compute global efficiency
